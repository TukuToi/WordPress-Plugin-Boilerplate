# Credits

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate journey commenced in 2011 with [Tom McFarlin](https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) at the helm, later transitioning to [Devin Vinson](https://github.com/DevinVinson) in March 2015. The collaboration included noteworthy contributions from [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton), [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich), and [Brad Vincent](https://twitter.com/themergency).

Beginning July 5, 2021, the Better WordPress Plugin Boilerplate found a new home with [TukuToi](https://www.tukutoi.com/) and its vibrant community. This hard-fork, now a standalone project, emerged from a desire to propel the original project forward, amidst a prolonged development hiatus on the original repository.

Our iteration of the Boilerplate not only revives but transcends its predecessor, introducing a plethora of modernized features while retaining a homage to the initial concept and its contributors. The evolution, spurred by community insights and the relentless pursuit of excellence, encapsulates a fresh, modern, and collaborative spirit propelling the WordPress and ClassicPress ecosystems forward.
