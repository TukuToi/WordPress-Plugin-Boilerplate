# Usage

This repository is not a Plugin you can download and install. The Plugin files instead are _included_ in the `src` folder of this Repository.

For detailed documentation on the Plugin usage and Development processes, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/TukuToi/better-wp-plugin-boilerplate/wiki).

# Credits

*This credits section is only here to honor the origins of the repository, as it is a hard-fork. The code has been 100% rewamped from the original.*

## Origins

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate journey commenced in 2011 with [Tom McFarlin](https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) at the helm, later transitioning to [Devin Vinson](https://github.com/DevinVinson) in March 2015. The collaboration included noteworthy contributions from [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton), [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich), and [Brad Vincent](https://twitter.com/themergency).

## Reason for hard-forking 

All the original maintainers are not activly contributing the project anymore, nor willing to let others contribute - **which was made very clear by blocking eager contributors**.

As a growing amount of PRs and requests piled up in the original repository, it became clear that someone needed to continue the work. This hard-fork, now a standalone project, emerged from a desire to propel the original project forward, amidst a prolonged development hiatus on the original repository.

## Curerent situation

Beginning July 5, 2021, the Better WordPress Plugin Boilerplate found a new home with [TukuToi](https://www.tukutoi.com/).

**Our iteration of the Boilerplate not only revives but transcends its predecessor, introducing a plethora of modernized features while retaining a homage to the initial concept and its contributors.** 

The evolution, spurred by community insights and the relentless pursuit of excellence, encapsulates a fresh, modern, and collaborative spirit propelling the WordPress and ClassicPress ecosystems forward.
